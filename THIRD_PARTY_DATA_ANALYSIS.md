# Third-Party Data Transmission Analysis

## Executive Summary
**✅ NO THIRD-PARTY DATA TRANSMISSION DETECTED**

The IBKR MCP Server code has been thoroughly analyzed for any potential data transmission to external parties. **The application only connects locally to your IBKR TWS/Gateway and does not send any data to third parties.**

## Detailed Analysis

### 🔍 Network Connection Analysis

#### ✅ **Local-Only IBKR Connection**
- **Host**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
- **Port**: 7496/7497 (local IBKR Gateway/TWS)
- **Connection Type**: Read-only (`readonly=True`)
- **Data Flow**: Your local IBKR app ↔ This Python server (localhost only)

#### ✅ **No External HTTP Requests**
- No `requests` library usage found in application code
- No `httpx` library usage found in application code  
- No external API calls or webhooks detected
- No analytics or tracking code present

#### ✅ **No External URLs/Domains**
- Only found: `https://api.ibkr.com/v1` in config (unused placeholder)
- This URL is **NOT used** for actual connections
- All real connections go to localhost (127.0.0.1)

### 📦 Dependency Analysis

#### **Safe Dependencies (Local-Only)**
- `fastapi` - Web framework (serves locally)
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server (runs locally)  
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variables (local file reading)
- `pydantic` - Data validation (local processing)
- `slowapi` - Rate limiting (local middleware)

#### **IBKR Connection Library**
- `ib_async` - Official Interactive Brokers Python API
  - ✅ Only connects to local TWS/Gateway instances
  - ✅ No external data transmission
  - ✅ IBKR-approved and standard client
  - ✅ Read-only connection prevents trading

#### **HTTP Libraries (Unused)**
- `requests` - Present in requirements but **NOT USED** in code
- `httpx` - Present in requirements but **NOT USED** in code
- These are common dependencies but have zero usage in the application

### 🔒 Data Flow Analysis

```
Your IBKR Data Flow:

❌ NO external connections
❌ NO third-party data transmission  
❌ NO cloud services or external APIs
```

### 🛡️ Security Verification

#### **Code Analysis Results:**
- ✅ No malicious network code detected
- ✅ No external API endpoints called
- ✅ No data exfiltration mechanisms
- ✅ No analytics or tracking services
- ✅ No webhook or callback URLs
- ✅ No unauthorized external connections

#### **Configuration Analysis:**
- ✅ All network binding to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- ✅ IBKR connection parameters point to local services only
- ✅ No external service credentials or endpoints configured

### 📋 Summary of Findings

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **External HTTP Requests** | ✅ None Found | No requests/httpx usage in code |
| **IBKR Connection** | ✅ Local Only | 127.0.0.1:7496/7497 (localhost) |
| **Third-Party Services** | ✅ None | No external APIs, analytics, or tracking |
| **Data Transmission** | ✅ Local Only | Only between local IBKR app and this server |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ Safe | Standard libraries, no external communication |
| **External URLs** | ✅ None Used | Config placeholder exists but unused |

## Conclusion

**The IBKR MCP Server is completely safe for local use and does not transmit any data to third parties.**

Your IBKR account data:
- ✅ Stays on your local machine
- ✅ Only flows between your local IBKR TWS/Gateway and this Python server
- ✅ Is accessed via the official IBKR API in read-only mode
- ✅ Never leaves your local network

The code is exactly what it appears to be: a local FastAPI server that connects to your local IBKR installation to fetch portfolio data for display/analysis purposes.
